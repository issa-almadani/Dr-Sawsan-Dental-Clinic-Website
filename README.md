# Dr Sawsan Sweiss Dental Clinic Webpage Project

This codebase includes the source code for a project to create and launch a local dentist's first web application featuring their business, services, and appointment management system.

The various goals of this project include:
- creating the various routes and pages of the website in Next.js
- designing the webpages using Tailwind.css
- deploying the application on Vercel
- registering a new domain name and deploying the website underneath it
- creating an appointment management system to potentially expanding to create a database for appointments, clients, and webpage users.

The project is currently in progress as of Summer 2024.
